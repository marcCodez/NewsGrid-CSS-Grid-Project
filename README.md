Part of the Modern HTML & CSS from the beginning course which I had to take due to my positive experience with Brad's JavaScript course. I created a news website using predominantly CSS grid layouts. This was also my first time deploying my website on netlify with my own domain and thus the form on the footer of the page will work when submitted, try it on http://www.marccodezdemo.com/
